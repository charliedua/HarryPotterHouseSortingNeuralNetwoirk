# Neural-Network-Library
This is a program created because of my love with calculus and programming,
I wanted to do something with maths and programming, so, I created this project.
if you think there is something is not working lemme know duaanmol2@gmail.com
I know, there is still some work needs to be done so you people can contribute 
and i'll accept pull request as I seem relavent.
People who want to write documentation are welcome.<br>
Steps to make documentation:
1. Make a directory `docs` if there isn't one.
1. add documentation in Markdown format using file extensions `.md`.
1. Creating of new files is okay if it is really required.
